# Video Collection Bundle

Symfony 2/3 bundle for defining a set of video collections based on static configuration that are
(mostly) interoperable between data providers.

Features include:

* Intuitive declarative configuration for managing video collections.
* No direct API interaction necessary - simply plug one of the data providers.
* Dynamic service definition - configured collections are accessible as injectable services.
